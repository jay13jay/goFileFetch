# goFileFetch
smal go program to download a file from the local network. part of the HackerPlayground toolkit

# i lied
well, not technically lied - it downloads a program, but also executes it
This was written to get around windows security features, as other methods
of downloading files weren't working on a box I needed to get files onto

It probably doesn't work anymore but some minor modification and maybe a run
through UPX and you should be sorted well enough
